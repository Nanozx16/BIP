Add utility for creating a new monorepo package (#3581)
## Explanation

Manually a new monorepo package can be a tedious, even frustrating
process. To spare us from that suffering, this PR adds a CLI that
automates most of the job for us, creatively titled `create-package`.

Most of the context / explanation for what this is and how it works can
be found in a new section within the [contributor
documentation](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/blob/create-package/docs/contributing.md#adding-new-packages).
In addition, here's the output of `yarn create-package --help`:

```text
create-package <cmd> [args]

Commands:
  create-package new      Create a new monorepo
                          package. Handles a lot
                          of the boilerplate for
                          you.
  create-package default  Create a new monorepo
                          package with default
                          values.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show help                  [boolean]
```

### Use of Babel

This PR introduces a new directory, `./scripts/create-package`, and
100%-coverage tests for this directory. Due to some kind of ESM-related
incompatibility between version `^27.0.0` of `jest` / `ts-jest` and
TypeScript `4.0.0` / `5.0.0`, these tests use `babel-jest` instead of
`ts-jest`. This required pulling in a suite of Babel development
dependencies. Local testing indicates that we can switch back to
`ts-jest` we've bumped the monorepo to `jest@^29`.
